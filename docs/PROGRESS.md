## Infrastructure (Sessions 0b-1)

| Task | Status |
|---|---|
| Assumption smoke test: 5 items verified and recorded | 🟢 results atop surface-testing-guide.md, 2026-07-04; (d) hosted endpoint down, earthaccess-direct fallback recorded; (a) via marketplace install, PARKING #5 |
| Surface-testing guide + prompts/ | 🟢 docs/surface-testing-guide.md + docs/prompts/{start,discover-data,report}.md (moved from docs-bootstrap in Session 1) |
| Org created (name availability confirmed) | 🟢 created by Paul 2026-07-04; PaulMRamirez admin |
| 7 repos scaffolded; canonical docs in marketplace/docs/ | 🟢 all seven pushed public 2026-07-04, Session 1 commits; docs-bootstrap deleted |
| marketplace add works; both plugins install | 🟢 Cd 2026-07-04: add succeeds, core and ocean-science install; needed owner + source-object fixes vs SPEC §2.2 (PARKING #6); Cw/Sc install of the real marketplace waits for Session 5 |
| knowledge/ + verification/ present; zero commands/ | 🟢 core, ocean-science, plugin-template; `find . -type d -name commands` = 0; template golden notebook green (exit 0) |
| 5 issue templates incl. new_knowledge_concept | 🟢 .github/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/{bug_report,feature_request,new_skill,new_domain_plugin,new_knowledge_concept}.yml |
| DCO app installed org-wide (step 8) | 🟡 needs Paul in the web UI: github.com/apps/dco → install for open-science-pillars, all repositories; blocking ruleset deferred to Session 14 |

## Session Log

| Session | Date | Actual hrs | Issues |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0b | 2026-07-04 | ~1.0 | osp conda env did not exist, created per guide prerequisites; hosted earthdata-mcp endpoint unreachable (local/Docker paths documented, fallback recorded); Science installs plugins via unlisted marketplace like Cowork (PARKING #5); ecco_access has no top-level ecco_podaac_download (use ecco_download / ecco_podaac_download_subset) |
| 1 | 2026-07-04 | ~0.7 | marketplace.json needed two schema fixes vs SPEC §2.2 verbatim (owner object; source objects instead of repository), PARKING #6; DCO app install left as a manual web-UI step; /doctor is TUI-only headless, description budget verified by count (28 skills, 3575 chars), interactive /doctor lands in Session 2; README-START-HERE.md retained in docs/ rather than deleted with docs-bootstrap |
| 2 | 2026-07-04 | ~1.0 | plugin updates are version-gated at 0.3.0, mid-build refreshes need uninstall/reinstall (decide: patch bumps per session or keep reinstalling); /doctor 2.1.201 has no skills section, /skills carries the budget check now (PARKING #7); ERA5-like fixture generated not committed per §6; behavior-test agent wrote a stray file beside the fixture, removed |
| 3 | 2026-07-04 | ~1.0 | pymannkendall hamed_rao returns NaN variance on ~1.5% of cells in per-cell map use; failure mode and deliberate-fallback rule captured in basic-statistics (ingest loop); figure-producing behavior tests take several minutes per headless agent run, plan Session 5 accordingly |
| 4 | 2026-07-04 | ~1.2 | none blocking; QC test kept honest by copying the bad fixture to a neutral name away from the README; plugin reinstall hot-loads skills into a running session (observed), useful for Session 5; T2 review caught the deliberately wrong 0.21 claim by recomputation |
| 5 | 2026-07-04 | ~1.8 | linter's first run caught 3 real frontmatter 🔴s (strict YAML vs Claude Code's lenient parser) plus a dead evidence URL; report-gate nuance: an explicit "saved as X" reads as confirmation given (recorded in behavior/report-gate.md); report Provenance cited skills rather than knowledge concepts, re-verify at Session 10; discover-data honestly surfaced ghrsst-mur placeholder status; Earthdata ~/.netrc set up and validated, ECCO velocity ShortName pre-verified in live CMR; behavior-test prompt class added (10 files) per Paul; Cw/Sc integration deferred |
| 6 | 2026-07-04 | ~1.5 | live PO.DAAC fast (209 MB in 7 s), tutorial-sample fallback never needed; ecco_access 0.3.1 quirks found and worked around: static collections get guessed nonexistent filenames (use earthaccess) and bare variable-name queries open an interactive picker that hangs scripts (use exact ShortNames), PARKING #10; V4R4B B-release rows for SSH/OBP discovered in the sweep, PARKING #9; linter check-11 rewordings applied on steward decision; ECCO data cache primed at ~/ECCO_V4r4 for Session 7 |
| 7 | 2026-07-04 | ~1.1 | MHT 26.5N live-validated: 2010 mean 1.098 PW inside 0.8-1.4, flux year downloaded in 15 s; close lint caught a real self-contradiction (budget-formulation's 1e-9-relative float32 claim vs epsilon ~1.2e-7), reconciled to round-off/epsilon framing with 1e-6 as explicit pass tolerance; conda-run heredoc stdin failure reconfirmed, scripts-from-files is the rule |
| 8 | 2026-07-04 | ~0.5 | no issues; ran sequentially rather than parallel-worktree (Session 7 momentum made the parallel split unnecessary); all nine ocean knowledge skills now authored |
| 8b | 2026-07-04 | ~1.9 | SWOT version-family split discovered by probe (cal/val only in D; C returns empty silently) and became verified gotcha evidence; crid drift within collections recorded; live loads cheap (8 regional granules ~9.4 MB each); volume gate demonstrated on a 7.25 TB request; linter caught three more check-11 phrasings (my recurring drafting habit, all reworded); load_swot golden's own sanity assert caught a fixture-magnitude bug before ship |
| 9 | 2026-07-04 | ~2.3 | two verified concepts corrected by the verification loop itself: heat-budget tolerance re-grounded on measurement (relative criteria meaningless below float32 quantization; now absolute 1e-10 degC/s), and the MHT recipe anchor rescoped after a skill-following test agent discovered it was the global circle not the Atlantic (basin decomposition verified: 0.666+0.430+0.002=1.098), PARKING #11; ecco_v4_py basin masks need binary data installed (env quirk, noted in recipe) |
| 10 | 2026-07-04 | ~1.6 | e2e exceeded spec: fetched real RAPID/MOCHA obs via DOI after the official page dead-ended in SharePoint (that discovery became the build's first operational ingest, rapid-mocha.md); e2e honored the local-config gate autonomously by narrowing its own window; eval seed finding: the house uncertainty rule does not reliably fire on uncoached computation prompts outside the report workflow (core uncertainty-statement FAIL, recorded for Phase-2 tuning); Cw/Sc surface pass remains with Paul |
| 11 | 2026-07-05 | ~1.2 | Quarto wasn't installed (prerequisite gap; user-space tarball install, no sudo); timing claims drafted before measurement were caught and replaced with measured values pre-review; T2 walkthrough ingested the SWOT crossover-calibration finding (ssha arrives uncorrected, +/-2.9 m ramp on flag-gated data) and the whole-pass spatial-match nuance; close lint then showed both SWOT skills routed around the new fact, accommodation diffs applied (PARKING #13 for gotcha promotion) |
| 12 | 2026-07-05 | ~1.4 | seeder test surfaced enrichment candidates our bundle lacks (C-to-D transition dates, 2024 telemetry window; drafts preserved as test artifacts for optional steward promotion); T3 walkthrough independently rediscovered both known ecosystem wrinkles and negative-tested its golden; Quarto book now three chapters |
| 13 | 2026-07-05 | ~0.9 | WASM export path exercised for the first time (marimo export html-wasm; embedded verified numbers, no credentials in-browser); application draft leans on built-Phase-1 evidence (closure numbers, RAPID episode, the scope catch); recording and submission remain with Paul |
| 14 | 2026-07-05 | ~0.8 | machine-side launch complete: READMEs polished, known-limitations honest (Code-verified-only list, the kept eval failure, ecosystem wrinkles), announcement drafted with pre-stated success criteria; T3 test's tide-gauges demo plugin found installed and cleaned up; human-side punch list handed to Paul (Cw/Sc packet, non-author Tutorial 2, directory submission, DCO, recording, AI4S submission) |
| 15 (v0.6 spec session) | 2026-07-05 | ~1.0 | Session 15's preconditions were unmet (outline only, no spec detail, triage queued); replanned on steward decision into the v0.6 revision: 13-item PARKING triage executed, SPEC 0.6.0 with §10, guide 2.4.0 with full S15-19 blocks, autonomy rows 15-19, pre-registration published before any Phase-2 result |
| 15 (build) | 2026-07-05 | ~1.3 | CMR audit found the reach/node collection split, the C/D repeat, LakeSP obs/prior/unassigned, L4 discharge, and SIMULATED pre-launch products in the same catalog (trap recorded); live granule pulls verified anatomy (127-attr reach, 57-attr node, 8x volume asymmetry); close gate caught a scaffold frontmatter escaping bug |
